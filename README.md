Cybersecurity Dashboard
This project is a dashboard for managing and searching security incident data using Elasticsearch, FastAPI, and React.js. It provides a powerful search interface and allows you to efficiently manage and analyze incidents.

Features
Elastic Search Optimization:

Sharding and replication for handling large datasets.
Aggregation support for summarizing data, such as incident counts by severity or attack type.
Large Dataset Integration:

Integration of large datasets of incidents from public sources.
Automatic downloading and indexing of new security incident data into Elasticsearch at regular intervals.
Advanced Search Functionality:

Fuzzy matching and real-time suggestions for searching incident titles and descriptions.
Advanced filters for severity, attack type, affected system, and timestamp range.
Flexible querying with wildcard or prefix search.
Incident Management:

Add, update, and delete incidents directly through the backend.
Bulk data upload functionality for incidents in formats like JSON or CSV.
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Setting Up the Environment
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd cybersecurity-dashboard
Set up Elasticsearch:

Launch Elasticsearch using Docker:
bash
Copy code
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.9.1
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:8.9.1
Verify Elasticsearch is running:
bash
Copy code
curl -X GET "localhost:9200"
Create an index for incidents:
bash
Copy code
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/incidents" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'<index-definition>'
Insert sample data into Elasticsearch:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/incidents/_bulk" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @sample_incidents.json
Set up the Backend:

Navigate to the backend folder:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the required Python dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the backend:
bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Set up the Frontend:

Navigate to the frontend folder:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the required Node.js dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React.js development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Features in Detail
Elasticsearch Optimization
Implement sharding and replication for improved performance and high availability.
Use Elasticsearch’s aggregation capabilities for summarized data insights, such as counting incidents by severity or attack type.
Large Dataset Integration
Integrate large datasets by importing security incidents from public data sources like Kaggle, security reports, or public feeds.
Set up automated scripts to download and index new data periodically.
Advanced Search Functionality
Use fuzzy matching for better search results in incident titles and descriptions.
Enhance search functionality with advanced filters, such as severity, attack type, and timestamp range.
Incident Management
The backend supports creating, updating, and deleting incidents.
Bulk upload incidents using the Elasticsearch bulk API with data in JSON or CSV formats.
