# Cybersecurity Dashboard

This project is a dashboard for managing and searching security incident data using Elasticsearch, FastAPI, and React.js. It provides a powerful search interface and allows you to efficiently manage and analyze security vulnerabilities and incidents.


## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.8+ and pip
- Basic knowledge of command-line tools

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  cd cybersecurity_dashboard-elasticsearch
  ```

2. **Launch Elasticsearch using Docker**
  ```bash
  docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.9.1
  docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:8.9.1

  Note: Make sure to update the elasticsearch password
  ```

3. **Verify elasticsearch is running**
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "localhost:9200"
  ```

3. **Set up the backend**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
  ```
